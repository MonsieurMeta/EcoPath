# Ecopath

Ecopath is a sustainability-focused web app that helps users sort trash correctly, rate bin accuracy, and track eco-friendly travel. Users earn ecopoints for green actions, which can be used to customize a virtual garden while connecting with local sustainability events.

## Project Structure

- **AI.py**: Contains all the API-related code, including access to OpenAI and other necessary integrations.
- **Static Pages**: Each page of the web app has a corresponding CSS, HTML, and JavaScript file for styling, structure, and interactivity.
- **Random Photos**: These are used for testing the image recognition feature.
- **Static Folder**: Contains all the assets and files required for the web pages, including images and stylesheets.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed for running `AI.py`.
3. Open the static pages in a browser to explore the web app interface.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install all the necessary dependencies mentioned in `AI.py`, `main.py`, and the javascript files  before running the app.

## Testing

Use the random photos provided in the repository to test the image recognition feature and validate the AI’s trash sorting accuracy.

## Future Plans

We plan to refine the AI’s accuracy, expand the virtual garden feature, and add more ways to earn ecopoints. We also aim to partner with local organizations for greater community impact.
