        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p></p>
            <h3>Effective Date: Yesterday</h3>
            <p></p>
            <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>Welcome to EcoPath! Ready to tread lightly on the earth? Hit ‘I Agree’ to embark on this green journey with us. Remember, this commitment sticks harder than gum on a hot sidewalk—once you press it, there’s no going back. By using our app, you promise to treat our planet with the same respect you’d show these terms.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>2. Eco-Pledges</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>Joining EcoPath means signing up for some serious eco-commitments:</p>
            <p></p>
            <li> <b>Peaceful Planet:</b> Promise to steer clear of any eco-terrorist groups. We’re all about peace, love, and responsible recycling.</li>
            <li> <b>Safety First:</b> Keep your hands off hot pavement and other risky surfaces—we care about your digits!</p>
            <li> <b>Art Preservation:</b> Avoid decorating valuable artworks with tomato sauce or any other creative mediums.</p>
            <li> <b>Eco Champion:</b> Commit to reducing your carbon footprint by walking more, driving less, and mastering the art of recycling.</p>
            <li> <b>Traffic Harmony:</b> Don’t block the flow—keeping traffic smooth reduces carbon emissions and stress levels!</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>3. Humor Clause</h3>
            <p>While EcoPath may tickle your funny bone, our commitment to the environment is no laughing matter. We mix humor with eco-conscious reminders, lightening the mood as we lighten our ecological footprint.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>4. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>Imitation might be the sincerest form of flattery, but copying our content is like sipping a single-use plastic straw—totally not cool. Treasure our material as you would a clean, thriving Earth.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
            <p>EcoPath is offered "as is," akin to a wildflower in a sprawling meadow. It’s natural to encounter a few bugs (we mean the software kind!), but rest assured, we're diligently working to improve.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>Should EcoPath inadvertently suggest planting a tree in an impractical location (like the middle of a soccer field), we ask for your patience and understanding. Our aim is to guide, not dictate!</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>7. Changes to Terms</h3>
            <p>Just as the seasons change, so may these Terms. We’ll ensure you’re in the loop with any significant updates—no surprises, just like an expected autumn leaf fall.</p>
            <p></p>
