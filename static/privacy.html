        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <!-- Tip Box Feature -->
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p>Welcome to the EcoPath Privacy Policy! Just like a secret garden, we keep your information safe and sound. By using EcoPath, you trust us with your data, and we’re more protective of it than a mother hen with her chicks.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>1. <b>Information We Collect</b></h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>We gather a bit of your data to make EcoPath as useful as a Swiss Army knife—but for eco-living! Here’s what we scoop up:</p>
            <p></p>
            <li> <b>Location Data:</b> We track where you walk, but not in a creepy way. We’re just here to cheer on every step you take towards reducing your carbon footprint.</li>
            <li> <b>Camera Access:</b> We’ll peek through your camera only to help identify recyclable materials and assess your garden’s health—think of us as your personal eco-assistant.</li>
            <li> <b>Account Details:</b> Username and password—you know, the usual suspects so we can keep in touch and send you eco-tips and updates.</li>
            <p></p>
            <h3>2. <b>How We Use Your Data</b></h3>
            <p>Your data helps us help you. It’s a symbiotic relationship, like bees and flowers:</p>
            <p></p>
            <li> <b>Personalization:</b> To offer advice as tailored as a bespoke suit made of recycled fabrics.</li>
            <li> <b>Improvement:</b> We analyze data to enhance EcoPath, ensuring it’s as efficient as a well-composted garden.</li>
            <li> <b>Communication:</b> To contact you with news about your eco-journey, but we promise not to spam—only organic, non-GMO emails from us!</li>
            <p></p>
            <h3>3. <b>Sharing Your Information</b></h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>We don’t share your data with third parties, because nobody likes a gossip.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>4. <b>Data Security</b></h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>Securing your data is a top priority, akin to locking up a bicycle in the city. We use industry-standard security measures, even though we sometimes wish we could use a dragon-guarded fortress.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>5. <b>Your Rights</b></h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>You’ve got the power to control your data:</p>
            <p></p>
            <li> <b>Access and Update:</b> Peek at your data anytime, like checking on seedlings in a sprout tray. If something’s off, you can update it to keep everything fresh and accurate.</li>
            <li> <b>Delete:</b> If you decide to leave us (which would make us as sad as a wilted plant), you can request to delete your data. We’ll handle it with the care of disposing of a biodegradable pot.</li>
            <p></p>
            <h3>6. <b>Changes to This Policy</b></h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy may grow and change, like a tree through the seasons. We’ll let you know about any updates, as clearly as explaining why leaves turn colors in the fall.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>7. <b>Contact Us</b></h3>
            <p></p>
